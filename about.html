                <div class="content-box">
                    <img src="images/director.jpg" alt="director">
                    <p>I am proud and honored to introduce you to the Business Leadership Center and the Stillman School of Business Leadership Development Honors Program.  I want to share information about our Program and the extraordinary opportunities it offers those individuals who have the passion and commitment to serve and, in the process, become more than they ever dreamed that they could be. </p>
                    <p>Our vision is to be a globally recognized program for leadership development that focuses on making leaders better. One of the Centers of the Buccino Leadership Institute, we believe leaders embody the 3 P's: Privilege, Purpose, and Passion. They understand that leadership is a privilege, that leadership without purpose is meaningless, and that passion is what inspires people to see you as a leader. We strive to instill these values by leveraging our unique positioning with the Stillman School of Business and the University and our strong relationship with our alumni and a strong advisory council comprising senior executives and entrepreneurs. </p>
                    <p>The outcome we look for is future global leaders in their chosen career, profession, and community grounded in functional, emotional, and situational skills and who embrace a global, digital, and learning mindset.</p>
                    <p>During their four-year journey, student leaders participate in unique learning opportunities and experiences that broaden and deepen their ability to be highly effective leaders. The development of self-knowledge early in the students' university career is a key focus since it is the foundation for highly effective and successful leadership. Special leadership lectures explore leadership theory as well as its practical and operational applications. From the freshman through senior year, students engage with senior executives and business professionals, who serve as their mentors and coaches, to learn from their rich and varied leadership experiences and challenges.</p>
