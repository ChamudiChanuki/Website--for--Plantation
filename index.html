                        Teak plantations have been widely established throughout the tropics to produce high quality timber in trees of good growth and stem form. Many factors affect the success of teak planting programmes including site, seed supply and seed quality, management and other biological factors such as insects. Site is the primary factor influencing plantation growth and development. Growth and yield of plantations grown in different site qualities, within and outside the teak region is illustrated.

                        Originally, jackfruit is a native of India and presently cultivated throughout the tropical low land in both the hemispheres. It is commonly grown in Burma and Malaysia and to a certain extent in Brazil. Wild jackfruit is found in Western Ghats of India. In India, jackfruit plantation is mostly done in Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Orissa, Kerela and Tamil Nadu. Its regular plantations are found only in U.P. where marginal orchards exist.

                        Mango thrives well up to 600 m above mean sea level provided locality is frost free and there is no high humidity or rains during flowering. The favourable temperature is 240 C to 270 C, however, it can tolerate temperature as high as 480 C provided that trees are getting regular irrigation.
